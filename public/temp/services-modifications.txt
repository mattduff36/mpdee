I want to re-vamp the 'Services' section. More specifically, the 3 'Website' services.
I want to change the service names from Essential / Business / Premium, to Bronze / Silver / Gold / Platinum. Here are the details:

Bronze will be a new service, which will be the most affordable. 

This package will deliver:
- 1 or 2 page basic holding page.
- free domain name (1 year)
- free hosting (1 year)
- Price starts at £100

Silver is the new name for the old 'Essential' package. Include everything from the old 'Essential' package and add:
- 3 months free support
- Price starts at £300

Gold is the new name for the old 'Business' package. Include everything from the old 'Business' package and add:
- 6 months free support
- Price starts at £550

Platinum is the new name for the old 'Premium' package. Include everything from the old 'Premium' package and add:
- 12 months free support
- Please contact for price.

So to summarize, I want the 3 current website packages replacing with the 4 'new' packages detailed above. I would also like the icons for each package changing to something more professional, and in-fitting with the professional website. Feel free to make suggestions or ask questions.
