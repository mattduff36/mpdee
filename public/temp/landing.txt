You want a parent landing page that introduces MPDEE and funnels people to one of three areas: Creative, Development, Support. Since it’s for an IT company, the page should feel clean, tech-driven, and a little playful without being overcomplicated. Here are options:

1. Interactive Logo Hub

Place the MPDEE logo in the center.

Each of the three divisions orbit around it (Creative, Development, Support).

Hovering highlights one with a short tagline and a smooth animation (e.g., glow, rotation, particle burst).

Clicking takes the visitor to that division’s website.

2. Split-Screen Intro

Landing page divided into three animated panels.

Each panel uses a distinct motion/visual identity:

Creative: soundwaves, equalizer animation, pulsing neon.

Development: code lines typing effect, circuit board animation.

Support: clean diagnostic/connection animation (loading bar, nodes connecting).

Hover expands the panel slightly; click zooms into the chosen section.

3. Animated Scene

A futuristic control room/dashboard with three glowing “terminals.”

Visitors “choose a terminal” (Creative, Development, Support).

On hover, animations run (music visualizer for Creative, lines of code compiling for Development, gears/spinning tools for Support).

This creates a “choose your path” vibe.

4. Minimalist with Motion

Use large text: “What are you here for?”

Three animated buttons fade in one after the other with subtle micro-interactions (hover effects, bounce, gradient shifts).

Keeps it clean and fast-loading but still engaging.

5. 3D/Parallax World

Build a 3D parallax environment where users scroll or move their mouse to “navigate” toward a choice.

Example: MPDEE logo in center, each division floating in space with icons (headphones for Creative, brackets for Development, wrench for Support).

Move the mouse → perspective shifts like a holographic interface.

6. Audio-Driven Landing

Since one area is audio, have the landing page react to ambient sound/beat animation.

A looping background track drives subtle waveforms that morph into three selectable icons.

Gives a strong Creative identity while still linking to IT.
