Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project: Cursor Website Redesign
Author: Matt Duffill
Date: July 10, 2025

1. Executive Summary
Business Goal
Redesign the current holding‐page site into a polished, professional web presence that clearly communicates your web design & development capabilities, showcases current projects, and drives qualified inquiries.

Problem Statement
The existing site is overly basic—just a landing page with a handful of project links. It doesn’t effectively demonstrate service offerings nor inspire confidence in prospective clients.

2. Objectives & Success Metrics
Objective	Primary KPI
Showcase portfolio & service expertise	Average session duration
Generate qualified inquiries	Number of form submits
Maintain brand consistency	Stakeholder satisfaction
Preserve existing animations and styling	Visual QA pass rate

3. Target Audience & Personas
Persona	Description	Needs & Motivations
Startup Founder	Early-stage entrepreneurs seeking MVPs or product launches	Inspiration gallery; proof of delivery
Marketing Manager	Corporate or agency marketers looking to outsource web projects	Case studies; clear service breakdown
Individual SME	Small business owners needing an online presence	Ease of contact; trust signals

User Journey:

Discover via referral/LinkedIn

Browse homepage → portfolio → services

Fill contact form

4. Scope & Features
4.1 Homepage & Navigation
Sections: Hero banner (with animation), “Our Services,” “Featured Projects,” “Get in Touch.”

Navigation: Simple top-nav; mobile hamburger menu. Retain current sticky animation on load.

4.2 Portfolio / Case Studies
Grid Layout: Thumbnail, project name, short description.

Detail View: Project overview, key technologies, outcomes, “Back to all projects.”

Filtering: Basic tag-based filter (e.g. “E-commerce,” “SaaS”).

4.3 Services Overview
Service Cards: Each service (e.g., UI/UX Design, Front-end Dev, Full-Stack Dev) with icon, description, “Learn More” modal.

No pricing displayed. CTA button “Discuss Your Project” opens contact form.

4.4 Lead Generation Form
Fields: Name (required), Email (required), Phone (optional), Project Details (optional textarea).

Validation: Front-end email format check, required-field indicators.

Submission Flow: On success → “Thank you” overlay; email notification to site owner.

5. UX & UI Requirements
Brand & Styles:

Colours & Typography: Preserve existing palette and typefaces.

Animations: Retain load-in animations on all key modules.

Responsive Design: Fluid layouts for desktop, tablet, mobile—no bespoke mobile-only features.

Accessibility: Meet basic accessibility best practices (alt text, keyboard nav).

6. Technical Architecture
Hosting & Deployment: Continue using GitHub → Vercel.

Framework: Any modern static-site framework supported by Cursor (e.g., Next.js).

CMS/Content: Hard-coded content or lightweight headless CMS if preferred—no dynamic blog.

Integrations: None (analytics optional future add-on).

7. Performance & SEO
Performance: Maintain existing page-load animations while keeping bundle size minimal.

SEO:

Meta titles/descriptions per page (“Home | Cursor,” “Portfolio | Cursor”).

Semantic HTML5 structure.

No multilingual or structured data requirements at this time.

8. Success Metrics & Reporting
Primary:

Form Submissions – track via Vercel analytics or simple email confirmations.

Average Session Duration – target +30% over holding-page baseline.

Secondary: (for future) heatmaps, bounce rate, organic traffic.

9. Timeline & Milestones
Although there’s no fixed deadline, we recommend the following phases to structure work:

Phase	Deliverables
Discovery	Finalized requirements; wireframes sign-off
Design	High-fidelity mockups; style specifications
Development	Component build; animations integration
QA	Cross-browser/device testing; bug fixes
Launch	DNS go-live; smoke test; post-launch review

10. Risks & Assumptions
Risks:

Scope creep (avoid by freezing requirements before design).

Animation performance on older devices (mitigate via performance testing).

Assumptions:

Current Vercel hosting can handle redesigned assets without change.

No CRM/email-marketing integration required at launch.

Next Steps
Wireframe Review: Approve basic layouts for homepage, portfolio, services.

Content Prep: Provide final text, images, project details.

Design Kick-off: Begin mockups once content is ready.
